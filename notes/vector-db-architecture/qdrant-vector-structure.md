# Vector Database Architecture Notes for suggest.watch

## What the Qdrant Migration Set Up (In Simple Terms)

Think of Qdrant as a massive digital library specifically designed to understand the "meaning" behind text, not just the words themselves.

### The "Collection" (Our Digital Library Section)

Collection Name: user_preference_signals
- Like creating a dedicated section in the library called "User Movie Preferences"
- This is where every user's taste signals get stored and organized

### The "Vectors" (1024-Dimensional Meaning Fingerprints)

Vector Dimensions: 1024 numbers per preference
- Each user preference gets converted into a 1024-dimensional vector
- Think of it as a "meaning fingerprint" with 1024 different characteristics
- Example: "I want something like Blade Runner but less depressing" becomes [0.23, -0.45, 0.78, ..., 0.12] (1024 numbers)

Distance Metric: Cosine similarity
- This is how Qdrant measures how "similar" two preferences are
- Cosine similarity is perfect for understanding semantic meaning, not just word matching

### The "Payload" (Rich Metadata Storage)

Beyond the 768-number vector, each preference can store unlimited additional data:

```json
{
  "user_id": 1,
  "signal_type": "query",
  "content": "Something like Blade Runner but less depressing",
  "liked_elements": ["philosophical themes", "sci-fi visuals"],
  "disliked_elements": ["bleak endings", "depressing tone"],
  "genres": ["sci-fi", "philosophical drama"],
  "viewing_context": "weekend_evening",
  "mood_preferences": ["contemplative", "uplifting"],
  "preference_strength": 0.85,
  "timestamp": "2025-01-23T20:00:00Z"
}
```

### The "Indexes" (Fast Search Infrastructure)

Three indexes were created for lightning-fast filtering:

1. user_id index: Find all preferences for a specific user instantly
2. signal_type index: Filter by type ("query", "feedback", "rating")
3. timestamp index: Find recent preferences or track evolution over time

### Capacity & Scale

Storage Capacity: Practically unlimited
- 24GB RAM on your AI X1 Pro can handle millions of preference vectors
- Each vector: ~4KB (1024 floats + metadata)
- Rough estimate: 6+ million user preferences before hitting memory limits
- on_disk_payload=True means metadata stored on disk, not RAM, for even more capacity

Query Performance: Sub-millisecond searches
- Cosine similarity search across millions of vectors: <10ms
- Filtered searches (user_id + preferences): <5ms
- 2.5Gbps network between containers ensures fast RAG operations

### Real-World Comparison

This is like having a movie sommelier with perfect memory who:
- Remembers every preference you've ever expressed (unlimited storage)
- Understands the meaning behind your words, not just keywords (768-dim vectors)
- Can instantly find similar preferences from your history (indexed searches)
- Gets smarter with every conversation (learning from preference signals)
