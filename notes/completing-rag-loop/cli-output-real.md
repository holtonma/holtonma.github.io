🎬 Generating movie recommendations with Llama 3.1 8B...

Based on the user's preference history, I've curated four thoughtful sci-fi movie recommendations that meet their requirements:

**1.** **"Sunshine" (2007)**

Description: A team of astronauts embarks on a mission to reignite the sun after it begins to die, facing personal struggles and existential questions along the way.

Why it matches their preferences: Like "Arrival," "Sunshine" explores themes of first contact and communication with an alien entity. The movie also has an upbeat tone, balancing action and emotional depth. Additionally, its focus on character development and relationships echoes the user's preference for good characters over nerdy sets (similarity: 0.724).

Confidence score: 0.855

**2.** **"Another Earth" (2011)**

Description: When a duplicate Earth appears in the sky, a young woman discovers that she has an identical twin on the new planet, leading to questions about identity and human connection.

Why it matches their preferences: This film shares similarities with "The Martian" by focusing on character-driven storytelling and exploring complex themes. Its tone is also more upbeat than typical sci-fi fare, making it a suitable match for the user's preference (similarity: 0.753).

Confidence score: 0.832

**3.** **"Passengers" (2016)**

Description: Two passengers on a spaceship wake up 90 years too early and must navigate their feelings for each other while trying to save the ship from destruction.

Why it matches their preferences: This movie combines elements of "Arrival" by exploring first contact and communication, but with a more romantic and upbeat tone. Its focus on character development and relationships also aligns with the user's preference (similarity: 0.728).

Confidence score: 0.819

**4.** **"Europa Report" (2013)**

Description: A team of astronauts embarks on a mission to one of Jupiter's moons, Europa, where they discover signs of life and must confront the implications of this discovery.

Why it matches their preferences: Like "Sunshine," "Europa Report" has an upbeat tone and focuses on character development and relationships. The movie also explores themes of first contact and communication with an alien entity (similarity: 0.739).

Confidence score: 0.805

Each recommendation is carefully chosen to balance the user's preferences for thoughtful sci-fi, good characters, and an upbeat tone.
