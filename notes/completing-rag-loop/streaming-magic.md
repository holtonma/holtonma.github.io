# 🎬 Streaming Movie Recommendations - The Magic

## 1. Real-time Token Streaming Callback

```python
# Create streaming callback for real-time display
async def streaming_callback(token):
    print(token, end="", flush=True)
```

## 2. Complete RAG Loop with Streaming

```python
# Pass formatted results to LLM for movie recommendations
recommendations = await llm_service.generate_movie_recommendations(
    user_query=query,
    similar_preferences=formatted_results,
    limit=4,
    streaming_callback=streaming_callback  # ✨ This makes it stream!
)
```

## 3. LLM Service Streaming Implementation

```python
async def _call_ollama_chat(self, prompt: str, streaming_callback=None) -> str:
    full_response = ""

    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        async with client.stream(
            "POST",
            f"{self.base_url}/api/generate",
            json={
                "model": "llama3.1:8b",
                "prompt": prompt,
                "stream": True,  # 🚀 Enable streaming!
                "options": {
                    "temperature": 0.7,  # Creative but coherent
                    "top_p": 0.9,        # Diverse vocabulary
                    "num_predict": 800,  # Detailed recommendations
                }
            }
        ) as response:
            async for chunk in response.aiter_lines():
                if chunk.strip():
                    data = json.loads(chunk)
                    if "response" in data:
                        token = data["response"]
                        full_response += token

                        # ✨ Stream each token in real-time
                        if streaming_callback:
                            await streaming_callback(token)
```

## 4. The Complete Pipeline

```python
print("🎬 Generating movie recommendations with Llama 3.1 8B...")

# Vector similarity search results → LLM context → Streaming generation
recommendations = await llm_service.generate_movie_recommendations(
    user_query="thoughtful sci-fi tonight",
    similar_preferences=vector_search_results,
    streaming_callback=streaming_callback
)
```

## The Result

Users see recommendations appear word by word as the LLM generates them, creating an engaging real-time experience that feels like talking to a movie expert who's thinking through their recommendations live.

### User Experience Flow

```
🔍 Vector search completes (fast) → Shows similar preferences

🎬 "Generating recommendations..." → Streaming begins

"Based on your preferences..." [appears instantly]
"**1. Sunshine (2007)**" [appears as typed]
"Description: A team of astronauts..." [continues streaming]

[User stays engaged watching recommendations form in real-time]
```

### Why This Works So Well

- **Immediate feedback**: User knows something is happening
- **Progressive revelation**: Builds anticipation as recommendations appear
- **Natural flow**: Feels like a conversation with a knowledgeable friend
- **Error resilience**: Partial results if connection issues
- **Perceived performance**: Feels much faster than batch processing

## The Innovation

This is the core innovation - combining vector similarity search with streaming LLM generation for personalized, real-time content recommendations! 🎯

**Vector DB (fast) + Streaming LLM (engaging) = Magical user experience**
