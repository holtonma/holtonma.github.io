# Streaming Implementation for Better UX

Streaming is much better for user experience! üöÄ

## Why Streaming is Better

### Current: "stream": false
- ‚ùå **Long wait** - User sees nothing for 3-5 seconds
- ‚ùå **All or nothing** - Complete response or timeout failure  
- ‚ùå **Poor UX** - No progress indication

### Better: "stream": true
- ‚úÖ **Real-time output** - Text appears as it's generated
- ‚úÖ **Progressive display** - User sees recommendations forming
- ‚úÖ **Better perceived performance** - Feels much faster
- ‚úÖ **More engaging** - Like watching the AI "think"

## Implementation with Streaming

```python
async def _call_ollama_chat_streaming(self, prompt: str) -> str:
    """Make streaming API call to Ollama for text generation"""

    full_response = ""

    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        async with client.stream(
            "POST",
            f"{self.base_url}/api/generate",
            json={
                "model": self.model,
                "prompt": prompt,
                "stream": True,  # ‚úÖ Enable streaming!
                "options": {
                    "temperature": 0.7,
                    "top_p": 0.9,
                    "num_predict": 800,
                }
            },
            timeout=60.0
        ) as response:
            async for chunk in response.aiter_lines():
                if chunk:
                    data = json.loads(chunk)
                    if "response" in data:
                        token = data["response"]
                        full_response += token
                        # Could yield token here for real-time display
                        print(token, end="", flush=True)  # Show progress!

                    if data.get("done", False):
                        break

    return full_response
```

## CLI with Live Streaming

```bash
> search thoughtful sci-fi tonight
üîç Found 3 similar preferences...

Based on your preferences, here are my recommendations:

1. **Her (2013)**
   A lonely writer develops a relationship with an AI operating system...
   [continues streaming in real-time]
```

Much more engaging!

## Technical Benefits

### Performance Perception
- **Streaming**: Users see progress immediately, feels fast
- **Non-streaming**: 3-5 second wait feels slow even if total time is same

### Error Handling
- **Streaming**: Partial results if connection drops
- **Non-streaming**: Complete failure on timeout

### Engagement
- **Streaming**: Users stay engaged watching text appear
- **Non-streaming**: Users might think system is frozen

## Implementation Notes

- Uses `httpx.AsyncClient().stream()` for async streaming
- `print(token, end="", flush=True)` for real-time CLI display
- Could be extended to yield tokens for web interfaces
- Maintains full response while streaming for processing

This creates a much more responsive and engaging user experience!
