[{"content":"About Mark Holton I\u0026rsquo;m a hands-on Software Architect with over two decades of experience building resilient, scalable systems. I specialize in data platform engineering, distributed architectures, and agent-driven systems that solve real-world problems.\nCurrently, I\u0026rsquo;m architecting data pipelines for GoToMarket Sales Intelligence at ShiftUpAI.com. Before that, I spent a decade building systems at Salesforce. Here I share what I\u0026rsquo;m learning about modern architectures, AI integration patterns, and navigating the next phase of a software engineering career.\nWhat I Do I spend my days designing and building:\nData Pipelines \u0026amp; Platforms - Scalable systems that turn raw data into actionable insights Distributed Systems - Backend architectures that handle complexity gracefully Agent-Driven Solutions - AI-integrated systems that enhance human capabilities Resilient Architectures - Systems that fail gracefully and recover quickly Philosophy After two decades in software engineering, I\u0026rsquo;ve learned that the best architectures are like good stories - they have clear structure, handle complexity gracefully, and actually solve real problems.
