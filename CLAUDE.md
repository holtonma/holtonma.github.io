## Deployment Issues Resolved ✅

### GitHub Pages Jekyll vs Hugo Conflict
**Issue**: GitHub Pages was intermittently running Jekyll instead of Hugo, causing posts to disappear randomly.

**Root Cause**: GitHub Pages defaults to Jekyll for any repository with markdown files. Even with custom Hugo workflows, it would sometimes override with automatic Jekyll builds.

**Solution**: 
1. Created `.github/workflows/blog_publish.yml` with proper Hugo workflow
2. Ensured GitHub Pages source is set to "GitHub Actions" in repository settings
3. Added `static/.nojekyll` file to disable Jekyll processing
4. Used `--cleanDestinationDir` flag in Hugo build for consistent deploys

**Key Files**:
- `.github/workflows/blog_publish.yml` - Custom Hugo deployment workflow
- `static/.nojekyll` - Disables Jekyll processing
- `.gitignore` - Excludes `public/` directory from version control

**Verification**: GitHub Pages UI should show "Deploy Hugo site to Pages workflow" as the source.
