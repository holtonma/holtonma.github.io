## Why Rerankers Are Important for RAG Applications: Some Research and Analysis

As I have [shared in the past](/posts/curiosity-and-craft/), I enjoy rolling up my sleeves and building to fully understand a tool, technique, or technology, especially when it's important to my craft. 

If you're building RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) applications, you've probably experienced this: your vector search returns decent results, but your LLM still generates mediocre responses, or responses that don't match up with the intended ask. The missing architectural piece might be a reranker‚Äîa specialized AI model that can greatly improve your retrieval quality.

Let me break down what rerankers are, why they matter, and how they could upgrade your RAG pipeline using real examples from building a side exploration app I have been building, called `suggest.watch`.

*Reranker Models - purpose built for relevance ranking*

## The Problem to Solve: When Search Results Miss the Point

Some background for context to help understand how this is used: `suggest.watch` is a side app I built to explore RAG applications when I get some time to dive into software architectures I want to understand.  The basic premise of the app is that it's like asking an LLM for movie recommendations, but over time the app "learns" your likes and dislikes over time through the use of RAG. The user as the tenant of the app, builds up his or her own set of vector relationships related to their past likes, dislikes of movies, shows, genres.  This is used when they talk to the LLM about subsequent movies. Unlike Netflix recommender or other services, it doesn't limit you to movies and shows on those platforms. It is just using your input over time, plus your input at the moment and bouncing that off the LLM.

I want to be able to enter:
> "in the mood for a dark detective mystery, on rainy London cobblestone streets, and make it a period movie!" 

...and get some recommendations that match my general interests based on previous inputs, my mood, and the vast intelligence of the LLMs.

Let's walk through an example use-case to help illustrate how this works and where rerankers fit in:

Sarah opens `suggest.watch` at 9 PM on Friday. She's had a long week and types: 
> *"I want something like Blade Runner but less depressing‚ÄîI need something thoughtful but not heavy tonight."*

This is exactly the kind of nuanced request that can miss the mark in recommendation systems. Let me show you what happened when I first built the MVP of my RAG pipeline versus what I learned we actually needed.

### Without Reranking: Our First Attempt (Swing and a Miss)

Vector search finds Sarah's past conversations:

```
1. "I love sci-fi movies" (similarity: 0.85)
2. "Blade Runner is a masterpiece" (similarity: 0.82) 
3. "I prefer movies from the 80s" (similarity: 0.80)
4. "Friday nights I want something lighter" (similarity: 0.78)
5. "Depressing movies ruin my mood" (similarity: 0.75)
```

Our AI sees "Blade Runner" ranked highly and recommends: **Blade Runner 2049**, **Ghost in the Shell**, and **Dark City**.

Sarah's reaction: *"These are exactly what I DON'T want right now!"*

The problem? Vector similarity found content about Blade Runner, but completely missed the crucial context and intent: "less depressing" and "not heavy tonight."

### With Reranking: Understanding Intent, Not Just Keywords

A reranker changes (and improves) this. It takes those same 5 conversation snippets from the vector DB and analyzes them against Sarah's specific request:

```
1. "Friday nights I want something lighter" (relevance: 0.95)
2. "Depressing movies ruin my mood" (relevance: 0.91)  
3. "I love thoughtful sci-fi but not heavy" (relevance: 0.88)
4. "Blade Runner is a masterpiece" (relevance: 0.84)
5. "I prefer movies from the 80s" (relevance: 0.72)
```

Now our AI recommends: **Arrival**, **The Martian**, and **Edge of Tomorrow**.

Sarah's reaction (hopefully): *"Perfect! Exactly what I was looking for."*

The reranker understood that her Friday night mood and aversion to heavy content were more relevant than her general love of Blade Runner.

## What Exactly Is a Reranker?

A reranker is a specialized AI model trained for one job: scoring how relevant documents are to a specific query. While your LLM is like a brilliant conversationalist, a reranker is like a laser-focused more objective critic who can quickly evaluate relevance.

### The Technical Reality: Why Not Just Use GPT/Claude?

This was my first question. Why can't I just ask Claude Sonnet 4 to rank my search results?

There are known reasons and I kicked the tires a little on these approaches to understand them. You can get more detailed obviously with this prompt, but for illustration purposes:

### Using Claude for Reranking
```python
# Asking Claude to rank 10 user preferences
prompt = f"""
Query: "I want something like Blade Runner but less depressing"

Rank these user preferences by relevance (1-10):
1. "I love sci-fi movies with philosophical themes"
2. "Blade Runner is amazing but too dark for tonight"
3. "I prefer movies from the 80s and 90s"
[... 7 more preferences ...]

Return just the numbers in order [insert strict output format instructions, etc]:
"""
```

**Results:**
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Time**: 3-5 seconds
- üí∞ **Cost**: $0.01-0.05 per ranking
- üìä **Scale**: Struggles and takes longer with 10+ documents
- üéØ **Output Reliability**: Good but variable (requires error handling for malformed responses - even with perfect prompting, you're still asking a generative model to do a task that dedicated rerankers are architecturally purpose-built for)

### Using Voyage Reranker
```python
results = await voyage_reranker.rerank(
    query="I want something like Blade Runner but less depressing",
    documents=user_preferences,
    top_k=5
)
```

**Results:**
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Time**: 200-500ms (10x faster)
- üí∞ **Cost**: $0.001-0.003 (10x cheaper)  
- üìä **Scale**: Handles 100+ documents easily
- üéØ **Output Reliability**: Architecturally consistent (designed to always return a valid score list, not generate text that might be malformed)

The difference is architecture. Generative models are trained to create text token by token. Rerankers are trained specifically to score relevance between query-document pairs. It's like asking a master chef to also be a food critic‚Äîthey can taste and evaluate, but their brain is wired for creating, not systematically scoring dishes.

## How Rerankers Actually Work

Rerankers use different architectures depending on their design:

### Cross-Encoder Architecture (Most Accurate)
```
[Query + Document] ‚Üí Single Model ‚Üí Relevance Score
```

**How it works**: The model processes the query against each retrieved document (vector search result) separately, seeing both together to understand their interaction.

![Reranker processing Sarah's query against user preferences](/images/reranker-diagram.png)
*Cross-encoder reranker scoring Sarah's query against her past preferences - each query-document pair processed separately*

**Example in RAG context**: 
- Query: "I want something like Blade Runner but less depressing"
- Document 1: "Blade Runner is amazing but too dark for tonight" ‚Üí Score: 0.95
- Document 2: "I love sci-fi movies with philosophical themes" ‚Üí Score: 0.72
- Document 3: "Friday nights I want something lighter" ‚Üí Score: 0.88
- (Each query-document pair gets processed separately to generate its relevance score)
- Model output: High relevance score (0.95) because it understands the contradiction

**Pros**: Best accuracy, understands subtle relationships
**Cons**: Slower because each query-document pair requires separate processing

### Bi-Encoder Architecture (Faster)
```
Query ‚Üí Encoder ‚Üí Query Vector
Document ‚Üí Encoder ‚Üí Document Vector
Similarity(Query Vector, Document Vector) ‚Üí Score
```

**How it works**: Creates separate embeddings for query and document, then computes similarity.

**Why it's faster**: 
- Documents can be pre-encoded into vectors once and reused
- Only the query needs encoding at runtime
- Similarity calculation is just vector math (cosine similarity, dot product)
- Can process many documents in parallel

**Why it's less accurate**:
- Query and document are encoded separately - no interaction during encoding
- Misses subtle relationships that emerge when text is processed together
- Example: Can't easily detect contradictions like "I love X but not when Y"

**Pros**: Much faster, can pre-compute document embeddings, scales well
**Cons**: Less accurate for complex relationships and nuanced queries

## Choosing the Right Reranker for Movie Recommendations

I chose movie recommendations as it has high relevance to the application of reranker models. The goal is to surface the most relevant films to a user's nuanced query. After vector search pulls a broad set of candidates, a reranker precisely sorts them based on semantic relevance before your LLM generates the final recommendations.

For a movie recommender RAG pipeline, here's which service fits different priorities:

### For Raw Performance & Accuracy: Cohere
Cohere's rerank-3 models are state-of-the-art at understanding complex queries like "show me a movie from the 80s about a group of friends who go on an adventure." They excel at identifying subtle semantic differences.

**Architecture**: Cross-encoder (processes query+document together for maximum accuracy)
**Pros**: Unmatched accuracy for nuanced movie queries - cross-encoders are the most accurate type because they process query and document together, allowing for rich interaction understanding.
**Cons**: Most expensive option, especially at high volume
**Best for**: Premium applications where recommendation quality is paramount

### For Speed & Cost-Effectiveness: Voyage AI
Voyage AI offers the best balance of performance and cost. Their rerank-2.5-lite model is designed for scenarios where speed and cost are critical‚Äîperfect for real-time recommendations.

**Architecture**: Optimized cross-encoder (speed comes from efficient implementation, not architectural simplification)
**Pros**: Fast, affordable, transparent pricing
**Cons**: Slightly less nuanced than Cohere for very complex queries  
**Best for**: Production systems with high query volume

### For Long Content: Jina AI
Jina excels at handling long documents with their sliding window approach. Less critical for typical movie metadata, but valuable if you're working with full reviews or scripts.

**Architecture**: Cross-encoder with sliding window (processes long documents in chunks)
**Pros**: Excellent at processing detailed movie reviews/content
**Cons**: Overkill for short movie descriptions
**Best for**: Systems using long-form movie content

### Recommendation: Start with Voyage AI

For movie recommendations, I chose **Voyage AI's rerank-2.5-lite** as the pragmatic choice:

- **Speed is king**: Users expect instant recommendations‚ÄîVoyage's low latency delivers
- **Cost-effective at scale**: High query volume won't break your budget (and for my side-app case, the query volume is low)
- **Sufficient accuracy**: More than accurate enough for excellent movie ranking

I can always upgrade to Cohere if you find specific query types that need the extra accuracy boost.

### Cloud-Based Rerankers

#### Cohere Rerank
- **Best for**: Raw performance & accuracy

- **Cost**: Standard embedding pricing
- **Limitation**: Bi-encoder only, less accurate than dedicated rerankers

## Different Example Use Cases for Rerankers for additional contex

### 1. E-commerce Search
**Problem**: User searches "comfortable running shoes for flat feet"

**Without reranking**: Returns all running shoes mentioning "comfortable"

**With reranking**: Prioritizes shoes specifically designed for flat feet

```python
# E-commerce example
query = "comfortable running shoes for flat feet"
products = vector_search(query, limit=50)  # Cast wide net
relevant_products = reranker.rerank(query, products, top_k=10)
```

### 2. Legal Document Retrieval
**Problem**: Lawyer searches "contract termination due to material breach"

**Without reranking**: Returns documents mentioning any of those terms

**With reranking**: Prioritizes precedents where material breach specifically led to termination

### 3. Customer Support
**Problem**: "My payment failed but I was still charged"

**Without reranking**: Returns general payment and billing articles

**With reranking**: Prioritizes articles about payment failures and dispute resolution

### 4. Academic Research
**Problem**: "machine learning applications in drug discovery"

**Without reranking**: Returns papers mentioning ML or drugs separately

**With reranking**: Prioritizes papers specifically about ML applications in pharmaceutical research

### 5. Content Recommendation (Our Use Case)
**Problem**: "I want something like The Office but animated"

**Without reranking**: Returns workplace comedies and animated shows separately

**With reranking**: Prioritizes animated workplace comedies like Bob's Burgers

## Implementation Strategy: Start Simple, Add Intelligence

Here's how I approached this in my codebase - start practical without it and iterate:

### Phase 1: MVP (No Reranking)
```python
async def get_recommendations(query: str, user_id: str):
    # Simple vector search
    preferences = await vector_search(query, user_id, limit=5)
    return await llm.generate_recommendations(query, preferences)
```

### Phase 2: Add Cloud Reranking When Quality Issues Emerge
```python
async def get_recommendations(query: str, user_id: str):
    # Cast wider net
    candidates = await vector_search(query, user_id, limit=20)
    
    # Rerank for quality
    preferences = await voyage_reranker.rerank(
        query=query,
        documents=candidates,
        top_k=5
    )
    
    return await llm.generate_recommendations(query, preferences)
```

## When Should You Use Rerankers?

### ‚úÖ Great Use Cases
- **Complex queries**: "Like X but not Y" type requests
- **Nuanced preferences**: User has specific qualifications or constraints
- **Large retrieval sets**: You're pulling 20+ candidates from vector search
- **Quality over speed**: Accuracy matters more than millisecond response times
- **Personalization**: Understanding user context and history

### ‚ùå Skip Rerankers When
- **Simple exact-match queries**: User wants "comedies from 2023"
- **Speed-critical applications**: Every millisecond counts
- **Limited API budget**: You're optimizing for absolute minimum cost
- **Already high-quality retrieval**: Your vector search is spot-on
- **Small document sets**: Only 2-3 options to choose from

## Cost Analysis: Cloud vs Local Rerankers

Based on suggest.watch usage patterns:

### Cloud Rerankers (Voyage AI)
- **Cost per query**: ~$0.05 per 1000 rerank operations
- **Monthly cost** (10k users, 5 queries each): ~$2.50
- **Pros**: No infrastructure, always updated, excellent accuracy
- **Best for**: MVP, high-quality requirements, unpredictable traffic

### Local Rerankers (BGE)
- **Setup cost**: GPU-enabled server (expensive)
- **Operating cost**: Electricity + maintenance
- **Monthly cost** (10k users, 5 queries each): ~$200 + electricity
- **Break-even point**: ~40,000 queries per month
- **Best for**: High volume, privacy requirements, cost predictability

## The Bottom Line

Rerankers aren't just another AI trend‚Äîthey're specialists that excel at understanding relevance in ways that general-purpose models simply can't match efficiently.

The TLDR example addition with `suggest.watch`, adding a reranker was the difference between:
- ‚ùå "Here are some sci-fi movies" 
- ‚úÖ "Here are thoughtful sci-fi films that won't ruin your Friday night mood"

The cost? A few extra milliseconds and pennies per request. The benefit? Users actually get closer what they're looking for instead of getting annoyed or confused.

If you're building RAG applications and struggling with relevance, don't just throw a bigger LLM at the problem. Certainly explore this bit of architecture and understand where it fits and can help!

## What's Next?

The reranker tools are evolving rapidly like most things with LLM-based apps:
- **Multimodal rerankers**: Understanding text, images, and audio together
- **Domain-specific models**: Legal, medical, e-commerce specialized rerankers
- **Explainable ranking**: Models that can tell you why they ranked something highly
- **Real-time learning**: Rerankers that adapt based on user feedback

`suggest.watch` serves as my testing ground for exploring these RAG technologies. The movie recommendation domain provides rich, nuanced queries which is nice for evaluating how different reranking approaches handle complex user intent.
