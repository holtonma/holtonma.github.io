## Why I Am Building This

Do you and your significant other ever sit down to watch a movie, and find yourself surfing previews for 30-45 minutes before giving up?  Of course Netflix has a strong recommendation engine, but it's tuned for maximizing engagement across their catalog, not necessarily reflecting your personal taste over time.

Let's say you wanted a recommendation engine external to Netflix that got better over time. Not limited to one platform's catalog, but something that learns your actual taste preferences and evolves with you.

That's the premise behind a sample app I created, which I am calling `suggest.watch` - a side project to understand how vector databases work in RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines. I wanted to explore by building around embeddings and similarity search and see how the pieces fit together.

## The Architecture We're Building

Here's the high-level flow we'll construct in this walkthrough:

![RAG movie pipeline flow](/images/mermaid-diagram-suggest-watch-vector.png)
*The architecture of the recommendation engine, showing how user input is processed in parallel for both semantic vector embedding and structured metadata extraction.*

This is the foundation of our advanced RAG system. But that second step, "Embedding & Metadata Extraction," is doing two crucial jobs at once. To truly understand a user's preference like "Something like Arrival but more upbeat," we need to process it in two parallel ways.

### A Dual AI Approach: Vectors and Structured Data

Think of this as giving our system two different ways to understand the user: one based on **feeling** and the other on **facts**.

1.  **Semantic Embedding (The "Feeling")**
    This is where we capture the *nuance* and *semantic essence* of the request. The raw text ("Something like Arrival but more upbeat") is fed to our embedding model, **`bge-large`**. It converts the entire phrase into a 1024-dimension vector—a mathematical "meaning fingerprint." This vector is what allows us to find other preferences or movies that *feel* similar, even if they don't share any keywords.

2.  **Metadata Extraction (The "Facts")**
    At the same time, we send the exact same text to a generative Large Language Model (LLM), like **Llama 3**, with a specific instruction: "Extract the key attributes from this text and structure them as JSON." The LLM's job isn't to create a vector, but to act like a diligent assistant, parsing the sentence and outputting structured data like this:

    ```json
    {
      "reference_content": "Arrival",
      "mood_preferences": ["upbeat"],
      "themes": ["sci-fi", "first contact"],
      "negative_constraints": ["not slow-paced"]
    }
    ```

    This structured data is stored as the **payload** alongside the vector in Qdrant. To ensure the LLM provides this data reliably, we use a library called Pydantic AI. It forces the model's output to conform to a strict, predefined JSON schema, eliminating errors and making the metadata predictable and useful.

### Why We Need Both

This dual approach is what makes the system more targeted towards my searches:

* **Vector search** finds you movies that are in the right "ballpark" of meaning.
* **Metadata filtering** lets you apply hard rules, like filtering for a specific `user_id`, `mood`, `genre`, etc

By combining these, we can perform highly sophisticated queries like: "Find preferences that *feel like* this new request, but only for `user_id: 1` and where `mood_preferences` includes `'upbeat'`." This gives us the best of both worlds: nuanced semantic search and precise, rule-based filtering.

## RAG Chunking

Somehow we have to take inputs and break them down into pieces that can be vectorized.  This is "chunking":

**General RAG chunking**: Breaking long documents into smaller pieces
- Example: Split a 50-page PDF into 500-word chunks
- Sometimes: Arbitrary boundaries, context loss
- Use case: Document retrieval, knowledge bases

**suggest.watch approach**: In this walk-through, each user preference is already naturally "chunked"
- Each conversation snippet: "Something like Arrival but more upbeat"
- Each feedback signal: "Loved the philosophical themes but too slow"
- Each rating context: "Perfect for Friday night viewing"
- Advantage: Semantically complete units, no artificial boundaries

**For this, we need a text-to-vector converter**
- In `suggest.watch`, each user preference is its own chunk. A comment like ‘Loved the themes but too slow’ is a self-contained, meaningful unit that we embed directly. This avoids the usual complexity of chunk size and overlap strategies.
- In this walk-through, I am using the BAAI/`bge-large` model, served locally through [Ollama](https://ollama.com/library/bge-large). There are various ways to run this model; another excellent option is the FastEmbed library, which is optimized for speed and ease of use. But the concept I wanted to illustrate here is that each user preference is its own embedding unit.

This eliminates the complexity of chunk size optimization, overlap strategies, and context preservation across chunks. Each preference signal is a complete, meaningful unit that captures user intent perfectly.

## Vector Database Foundation: Qdrant Setup

![AI robot with bow and arrow representing vector similarity search and targeting in RAG pipelines](/images/markbot_vectors.jpg)
*Vector databases like Qdrant store 'meaning fingerprints,' allowing an AI to find the closest semantic match.*

### The Collection Structure

Think of Qdrant as a digital library designed to understand "meaning" behind text, not just keywords.

**Collection Name**: `user_preference_signals`
- Like creating a dedicated library section called "User Movie Preferences"
- Each vector is like a book placed in that section — but instead of being sorted by title, it’s sorted by meaning.
- Stores every user's taste signals with semantic organization

### The Vectors: 1024-Dimensional Meaning Fingerprints

**Vector Dimensions**: 
- Each user preference gets converted into a 1024-dimensional vector
- In this setup, the `bge-large` model generates 1024-dimensional vectors. Different embedding models may produce shorter or longer vectors, but the idea is the same: each preference is represented as a fixed-length fingerprint of meaning.
- Think of it as a "meaning fingerprint" with 1024 different characteristics
- Example: "I want something like Blade Runner but less depressing" becomes `[0.23, -0.45, 0.78, ..., 0.12]` (1024 numbers)

**Distance Metric**: Cosine similarity
- How Qdrant measures how "similar" two preferences are
- Cosine similarity measures how close two meaning fingerprints point in space. If two vectors point in the same direction, Qdrant sees them as semantically similar — even if the exact words differ (not just word matching)

### Rich Metadata Storage

Beyond the 1024-number vector, each preference stores unlimited additional data:

```json
{
  "user_id": 1,
  "signal_type": "query",
  "content": "Something like Blade Runner but less depressing",
  "liked_elements": ["philosophical themes", "sci-fi visuals"],
  "disliked_elements": ["bleak endings", "depressing tone"],
  "genres": ["sci-fi", "philosophical drama"],
  "viewing_context": "weekend_evening",
  "mood_preferences": ["contemplative", "uplifting"],
  "preference_strength": 0.85,
  "timestamp": "2025-01-23T20:00:00Z"
}
```

### Performance Specifications

**Storage Capacity**: Practically unlimited
- 24GB RAM can handle millions of preference vectors
- Each 1024-float vector is about 4KB, not counting metadata. With 24GB RAM, that translates to several million vectors in memory. In practice, exact capacity depends on your metadata size and configuration.
- Rough estimate: 6+ million user preferences before hitting memory limits
- `on_disk_payload=True` stores metadata on disk for even more capacity
- This rich metadata means you can filter or personalize recommendations not just by semantic similarity, but also by mood, context, or even viewing habits.

**Query Performance**: Sub-millisecond searches
- On typical hardware, cosine similarity search across millions of vectors often completes in just a few milliseconds. 
- Adding filters (like `user_id`) usually makes queries even faster since the search space is narrowed.

## Setting Up the Embedding Model: `bge-large`

### Why BAAI's `bge-large` (or multilingual variants)

I use the [BAAI bge-large embedding model](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-large-en), served locally via Ollama.

**Quality Benefits**:
- **1024 dimensions** - provides a rich semantic representation that works well for nuanced user preferences
- **State-of-the-art English embeddings** for preference understanding
- **Broad semantic coverage** = captures subtle taste nuances
- **Does well for recommendation systems due to its ability to understand complex preference relationships.

**Architecture Advantages**:
- **Ollama integration**: Runs locally within existing infrastructure
- **Local inference**: Complete privacy + performance control
- **Clean pipeline**: FastAPI → Ollama (bge-large) → Qdrant architecture

### Processing User Preferences

The core calls when a user preference is extracted, generated and embedded in the vector database: 
```python
# 'learning_agent', 'embedding_service', 'settings', and 'self' 
# (with qdrant_client, user_id, collection_name) are defined elsewhere.

async def add_preference(self, preference_text: str) -> str:
    """
    Processes a user's preference, generates an embedding, extracts metadata,
    and stores the result as a point in the Qdrant vector database.

    Args:
        preference_text: The natural language text of the user's preference.

    Returns:
        The unique ID of the point created in the database.
    """
    # Step 1: Extract structured metadata from the preference text.
    try:
        result = await learning_agent.process_query_signal(
            user_id=self.user_id,
            query=preference_text
        )
        preference_signal = result.output
    except Exception as e:
        # In case of failure, create a fallback object. A real app would log this error.
        preference_signal = type('PreferenceSignal', (), {
            'metadata': {'error': 'extraction_failed', 'reason': str(e)},
            'preference_strength': 0.5,
            'signal_type': 'fallback_query'
        })()

    # Step 2: Generate a vector embedding for the preference text.
    embedding = await embedding_service.embed_text(preference_text)

    # Step 3: Create the Qdrant point with the vector and payload.
    point_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    point = PointStruct(
        id=point_id,
        vector=embedding,
        payload={
            "user_id": self.user_id,
            "signal_type": preference_signal.signal_type,
            "content": preference_text,
            "metadata": preference_signal.metadata,
            "preference_strength": preference_signal.preference_strength,
            "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
        }
    )

    # Step 4: Upsert the point into the Qdrant collection.
    self.qdrant_client.upsert(
        collection_name=self.collection_name,
        points=[point],
        wait=True  # Ensure the operation is completed before returning.
    )

    return point_id
```

> 
> **Output Validation**: This is a crucial final defense. Our architecture's use of Pydantic AI is a powerful security control. By forcing the LLM's output to conform to a strict, predefined JSON schema, we can simply reject any response that was successfully manipulated or malformed by an injection attack.

As we add utterances related to our movie preferences, they get extracted by Pydantic AI sent to the embedding model, and their resulting vectors stored in Qdrant:
```bash
> add Something like Arrival but more upbeat

*As vectors are added in Qdrant they get a unique ID, and their content is stored along with relevant metadata, as shown above for a user preference "chunk"*


**Pipeline breakdown**:
- 🔹 **Vector Generation (`bge-large`)** is the embedding model. This is an API call to Ollama converts to 1024-dimensional embedding. It turns the entered raw text into a high-dimensional vector representation. That’s what enables fast similarity search, clustering, and semantic retrieval. It’s not parsing the structure into “themes” or “genres” — it’s just encoding meaning into numbers.
- 🔹 **Preference Extraction ([Pydantic AI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/))**: This is the schema enforcement layer. We use Pydantic AI (a library that leverages Pydantic models to guarantee structured, validated output from an LLM) to turn the user's raw text into predictable JSON.
- 🔹 `Vector Storage (Qdrant)` Stores with rich metadata and calculates preference strength (0.80)

### Building a Rich Preference Profile

Let's add more varied preferences to see the intelligence:

```bash
> add I like sci-fi, but with good characters, it can't be just about the nerdy sets
✅ Stored preference vector in Qdrant
   📊 Vector dimensions: 1024
   🏷️  Preference strength: 0.70
   📝 Extracted metadata: ['subgenre', 'importance']

> add I need character development, not just explosions and CGI
✅ Stored preference vector in Qdrant
   📊 Vector dimensions: 1024
   🏷️  Preference strength: 0.80
   📝 Extracted metadata: ['themes', 'anti_preferences', 'complexity_preference', 'pacing_preference', 'emotional_weight', 'narrative_style']

> add More like The Martian less like depressing Black Mirror
✅ Stored preference vector in Qdrant
   📊 Vector dimensions: 1024
   🏷️  Preference strength: 0.80
   📝 Extracted metadata: ['genre_preferences', 'mood_preferences', 'theme_preferences', 'pacing_preferences', 'complexity_preferences', 'reference_titles']

> add No superhero movies, I'm burned out on them
✅ Stored preference vector in Qdrant
   📊 Vector dimensions: 1024
   🏷️  Preference strength: -0.80
   📝 Extracted metadata: ['reason', 'strength', 'genre', 'subgenres', 'temporal_state']
```

![QDrant UI for user preference signals](/images/vector_animated.gif)
*Showing Content, Metadata, and graph visualization in Qdrant for the vectors we just added to `user_preference_signals` collection. Qdrant supplies this out of the box for collections. E.g. if you have a container running on `192.168.nn.nnn` and a collection named `user_preference_signals`, you will see it at:  http://192.168.nn.nnn:6333/dashboard#/collections/user_preference_signals/graph*

**Intelligence patterns emerging**:
- **Preference strength variations**: From 0.70 to -0.80 (negative for dislikes)
- **Dynamic metadata extraction**: 2-6 fields depending on complexity
- **Semantic understanding**: Recognizes "burnout" as temporal, not permanent
- **Comparative reasoning**: Handles "More like X, less like Y" patterns

## Vector Similarity Search: The Magic Moment

Now for the payoff - let's search our preference database for "thoughtful sci-fi tonight" and see what we get:

```bash
> search thoughtful sci-fi tonight
🔍 Searching for: 'thoughtful sci-fi tonight'
🔢 Generating query embedding with bge-large...
🎯 Searching Qdrant for similar preferences...
🎉 Found 3 similar preferences:

#1 (Similarity: 0.679)
   💬 "I like sci-fi, but with good characters, it can't be just about the nerdy sets"
   📅 2025-09-01T15:57:51.991404
   🏷️  Tags: character_driven, primary

#2 (Similarity: 0.668)
   💬 "Something like Arrival but more upbeat"
   📅 2025-09-01T15:55:00.091649
   🏷️  Tags: Arrival, ['science fiction', 'drama'], ['first contact', 'communication', 'aliens'], upbeat, lighter, high, moderate, movie

#3 (Similarity: 0.666)
   💬 "More like The Martian less like depressing Black Mirror"
   📅 2025-09-01T15:58:38.425104
   🏷️  Tags: {'sci_fi': 0.8, 'thriller': 0.6, 'horror': -0.7, 'dystopian': -0.8}, {'optimistic': 0.9, 'tense': 0.6, 'depressing': -0.9, 'dark': -0.7}, {'science': 0.8, 'survival': 0.8, 'problem_solving': 0.9, 'technology_dangers': -0.7}, {'methodical': 0.7}, {'high': 0.8, 'intellectual': 0.8}, {'positive': ['The Martian'], 'negative': ['Black Mirror']}
```

### What Just Happened (No LLM Involved!)

This is **pure vector similarity** - no LLM in the search loop yet:

- ✅ **Semantic understanding**: "thoughtful" matched "good characters" 
- ✅ **1024-dimensional matching**: BGE-large embeddings found related preferences
- ✅ **Intelligent ranking**: Cosine similarity scores (0.679, 0.668, 0.666)
- ✅ **Context preservation**: Each result includes rich metadata

**Semantic intelligence demonstrated**:

Query: **"thoughtful sci-fi tonight"** found:
1. **"sci-fi, but with good characters"** (0.679) - Vector understood: "thoughtful" ≈ "good characters"
2. **"Something like Arrival but more upbeat"** (0.668) - Matched cerebral sci-fi content  
3. **"More like The Martian less like depressing Black Mirror"** (0.666) - Understood intelligent problem-solving content

## The Foundation is Ready

At this point, we have a vector database pipeline working:

- ✅ **Semantic storage**: 1024-dimensional preference vectors with rich metadata
- ✅ **Intelligent search**: Cosine similarity finding relevant preferences  
- ✅ **Local infrastructure**: `bge-large` + Qdrant running with no external dependencies
- ✅ **Natural chunking**: Each preference is the perfect semantic unit

But here's the natural question readers will have:

*"Okay, so I found similar preferences... now what? How do I turn this into actual movie recommendations?"*

## What's Next

In the next post, I'll show how these preference vectors become the foundation for LLM-powered recommendation generation. We'll take those similarity results (0.679, 0.668, 0.666) and demonstrate how they provide rich context for generating actual movie recommendations.

The vector database gives us intelligent retrieval. The LLM gives us intelligent reasoning. Together, they create a recommendation system that understands both what you like and why you like it.
