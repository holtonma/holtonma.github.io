When we think about the people we admire most, their stories often reveal the core values that matter to us, and we can see common threads that shine a light what principled success really looks like.

## David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH): The Power of Opinionated Pragmatism

*David Heinemeier Hansson: Balancing code, racing, and life with principled pragmatism*

DHH didn't just create Ruby on Rails—he carved out an entire philosophy around software development and life balance. What strikes me most about him isn't just technical and practical brilliance, but his unwavering commitment to principled pragmatism.

Grateful to have "grown up" in software the last 2+ decades with DHH's ascendance on Rails, and always paid close attention to his thoughts on various topics, and he consistently delivers thoughtful, considered responses. He's built and nurtured an entire community around Rails, demonstrating that technical leadership extends far beyond code.

What I admire most is his refusal to let work consume life, or life diminish work. He's proven that you can be wildly successful while maintaining that both career and personal fulfillment are key priorities—they don't compete, they complement. His racing career, his writing, his family life—none of these are afterthoughts to his professional success.

I don't agree with every position he takes, but I deeply respect the honesty and passion with which he expresses his views. He's remained opinionated based on core values, never backing down from what he believes, while charting his own course and purusing fulfillment rather than following conventional wisdom.

## J.K. Rowling: Creativity, Connection, and Courage

*J.K. Rowling's magical world: Where creativity meets courage and principle*

Rowling's impact on my life goes beyond her literary genius. The Harry Potter series became a bridge between me and my children—a shared world that we still reference and enjoy together today. That connection, that ability to create something that brings people together across generations, is remarkable.

But what I admire most is how her principles shine through her work. The themes of courage, friendship, standing up to injustice, and the complexity of good and evil aren't just plot devices—they're reflections of her values.

Her success came later in life, built on years of perseverance through rejection and personal struggles. She faced criticism, particularly in recent years, but never cowered. She stands on principle, and the criticism doesn't seem to affect her path or her life. There's something powerful about someone who finds their success through staying true to themselves, regardless of external pressure.

## Bruce Lietzke: Internal Scorecards and True Priorities

Bruce Lietzke might be the most obscure of the three, but his approach to life resonates deeply with me. He was a champion professional golfer who deliberately played a very limited schedule. While others chased rankings and prize money, Lietzke prioritized his children's games and fishing trips over tournaments and external recognition.

Competitive golf helped shape my life, and grateful to have watched Bruce choose this path. His influence here is an example of an impact that can be made without the headlines.

His success came from within and from family. He understood that true recognition—the kind that matters—doesn't come from trophies or headlines or a position on the Money List. It comes from living in alignment with what you value most.

In a profession that demands constant travel and relentless competition, Lietzke chose differently. He proved that you can excel at the highest level while refusing to sacrifice what matters most. His internal scorecard was the only one that counted.

## The Common Thread: Principled Authenticity

Looking at these three individuals, the commonality is: they each stayed true to their core values while achieving extraordinary success. They didn't adapt their principles to fit external expectations—they built their success around their principles.

DHH's pragmatic idealism, Rowling's creative courage, and Lietzke's priority clarity all demonstrate that authentic success comes from within. They show us that we don't have to choose between achievement and authenticity, between success and our values.

Their examples remind me that clarity about what matters most isn't just helpful—it's essential. When we understand our core values, when we own our choices and career direction, we stop waiting for organizations or circumstances to define success for us. We take ownership of our path.

As I reflect on these three remarkable people, I'm reminded that the goal isn't to become them—it's to become more authentically ourselves, guided by the same kind of principled clarity that made them who they are.
