![Software architect Mark Holton working on distributed systems and data pipeline architecture](/images/data_engineer.jpg)

I'm a hands-on Software Architect with over two decades of experience building resilient, scalable systems.

Before anything else, I spent over a decade at [Salesforce](https://salesforce.com) building distributed systems and large-scale data platforms. Most recently, I was a Lead Architect at [ShiftUpAI.com](https://shiftupai.com), where I architected data pipelines for Go-To-Market Sales Intelligence.

I'm now the founder of [NoraFoundry.dev](https://norafoundry.dev), where I build durable, local-first software systems designed for long-term use.

I created **KEEP** — a sovereign, desktop portfolio management system focused on structure, memory, and judgment in long-term investing.

Here I share what I'm learning about modern architectures, AI integration patterns, and navigating the next phase of a software engineering career.

## What I Do

I spend my days designing and building:

- **Data Pipelines & Platforms** - Scalable systems that turn raw data into actionable insights
- **Distributed Systems** - Backend architectures that handle complexity gracefully
- **Agent-Driven Solutions** - AI-integrated systems that enhance human capabilities
- **Resilient Architectures** - Systems that fail gracefully and recover quickly
- **Local-First Desktop Applications** - Sovereign software designed for durability
