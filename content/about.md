![Software architect Mark Holton working on distributed systems and data pipeline architecture](/images/data_engineer.jpg)

I'm a hands-on Software Architect with over two decades of experience building resilient, scalable systems. I specialize in data platform engineering, distributed architectures, and agent-driven systems that solve real-world problems.

Currently, I'm architecting data pipelines for GoToMarket Sales Intelligence at [ShiftUpAI.com](https://shiftupai.com). Before that, I spent a decade building systems at [Salesforce](salesforce.com). Here I share what I'm learning about modern architectures, AI integration patterns, and navigating the next phase of a software engineering career.

## What I Do

I spend my days designing and building:
- **Data Pipelines & Platforms** - Scalable systems that turn raw data into actionable insights
- **Distributed Systems** - Backend architectures that handle complexity gracefully
- **Agent-Driven Solutions** - AI-integrated systems that enhance human capabilities
- **Resilient Architectures** - Systems that fail gracefully and recover quickly

## Philosophy

After two decades in software engineering, I've learned that the best architectures are like good stories - they have clear structure, handle complexity gracefully, and actually solve real problems. I believe in building both systems and life intentionally.

## Publications

I've written about data platform engineering and fault-tolerant system design:

- **[Building a Fault-Tolerant Data Pipeline for Chatbots](https://engineering.salesforce.com/building-a-fault-tolerant-data-pipeline-for-chatbots-47d74bc31f5b/)** - Salesforce Engineering Blog
- **[Building a Scalable Event Pipeline with Heroku and Salesforce](https://engineering.salesforce.com/building-a-scalable-event-pipeline-with-heroku-and-salesforce-2549cb20ce06/)** - Salesforce Engineering Blog

## Patents

- **[Signals and Measurement of Business Goals in a Chatbot Platform](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20240095240A1/en?inventor=Mark+Holton)** - US Patent 17/932,750, Filed Sep 16, 2022, Granted Oct 8, 2024
